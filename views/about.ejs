<h4>Hello, this is Sumanth JM</h4>
<h4>This is my first web application using NodeJs, ExpressJs, and MongoDB. Do support.</h4>
<h4>This web application requires Node.js and a MongoDB database (with a free cluster available). You'll also need to create a `.env` file to securely store your credentials, including the MongoDB URI and a JWT secret for authentication.

    Once you have Node.js installed and your MongoDB cluster set up, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your MongoDB URI and a JWT secret according to the provided example format.
    
    To install the necessary dependencies for the project, run `npm install`. After installing dependencies, you can start the server by running `npm run dev`.
    
    This web application provides a platform for building a blog. It includes features for user authentication and utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication. The MongoDB database serves as the backend storage for the blog content, and the Node.js server handles the application logic and communication with the database.
    
    By following the installation steps and starting the server, you can run the web application locally, allowing you to create and manage a blog with user authentication and secure database storage.</h4>
